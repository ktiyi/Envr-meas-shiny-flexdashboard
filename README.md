Environmental Measures Dashboard with R shiny and flexdashboard
***
- This dashboard is programmed in R and enables interactivity by using Shiny with flexdashboard.
- It mainly focuses on data visualization rather than giving details of data wrangling process. All the read-in data has been properly cleaned, combined, and wrangled separately from the source code R Markdown (.rmd) file based on the originally collected data from data source.
- Data cleaning process mainly involves data reshaping and combining, as well as dealing with a small part of missing data with little manipulation. Therefore, the originally collected data can be fully reflected in the visualization.
- Visualizations in the dashboard are created mainly using ggplot2 and plotly, depict data in different ways with a variety of graph types (including animation), and let data tell the story.
- The **About** page in the dashboard provides details on data source information
